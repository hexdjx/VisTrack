# New improved tracker, code coming soon.  

## Trackers
Here is a list of my improved trackers.

[Raw tracking results and trained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/182NbsBrVR9PICR9aSkb2IhUDvrlSsTDT?usp=sharing)  
* Exploring Reliable Visual Tracking via Target Embedding Network (RVT), Knowledge-Based Systems, 2022. [[Paper]]((https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2022.108584))
* Learning Object-Uncertainty Policy for Visual Tracking (OUPT), Information Sciences, 2022. [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2021.09.002)
* Variable Scale Learning for Visual Object Tracking (VSLT), Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 2021. [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-03469-2)  

## Findings
* The UAV123 results of pysot and pytracking are consistent, which are lower than the results of got10k toolkit. 
  From the results reported in the original conference papers, the authors probably use the evaluation results given by got10k.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks for the great [PyTracking](https://github.com/visionml/pytracking) Library, which helps us to quickly implement our ideas.
